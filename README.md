# Verilog-Projects

An 8bit ALU implement using XILINX ISE.
It has 2 8bit inputs,3bit opcode and 1 8bits output.
5 Status flags-carry,zero,sign,parity,overflow.

Opcode --- Functionality
000    --- Addition
001    --- Subtraction
010    --- Bitwise AND
011    --- Bitwise OR
100    --- Bitwise XOR
101    --- Incement A
110    --- Decrement A
111    --- NOT A
