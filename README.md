# ALU 8-bit

An 8bit ALU implement using XILINX ISE.
It has 2 8bit inputs,3bit opcode and 1 8bits output.
5 Status flags-carry,zero,sign,parity,overflow.

Opcode --- Functionality <br />
000    --- Addition <br />
001    --- Subtraction <br />
010    --- Bitwise AND <br />
011    --- Bitwise OR <br />
100    --- Bitwise XOR <br />
101    --- Incement A <br />
110    --- Decrement A <br />
111    --- NOT A <br />
